# 📈 Monthly Sales Analysis (NumPy + Pandas + Matplotlib + Seaborn)

## 📌 Project Description
This project focuses on generating, analyzing, and visualizing one year of simulated monthly sales data for four distinct products (A, B, C, D). It utilizes core Python data science libraries to compute key business metrics, identify performance trends, and extract actionable insights.

The primary objective is to perform a comprehensive monthly sales analysis and extract key business insights using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project files are organized as follows:

* `notebook.ipynb`: Main notebook containing all the steps for data analysis, metric calculation, and visualization.
* `utils.py`: Contains functions necessary for data generation, including generating random sales data.
* `data/initial.csv`: The raw generated dataset.
* `data/final.csv`: The DataFrame containing calculated monthly metrics (e.g., Total Sales, Month-over-Month Growth, Quarter, Max/Min Sales Product).
* `data/output.csv`: The final results, including computed pivot tables and summaries.
* `conclusions.txt`: A text file dedicated to answering the conclusion questions and outlining the strategic insights.
* `README.md`: This file.

## 📊 Key Findings and Results
The analysis successfully calculated several key metrics and identified the top performers based on the annual sales data:

* **Best Month (Highest Total Sales):** Identified
* **Best Product (Highest Cumulative Annual Sales):** Identified
* **Best Quarter (Highest Total Sales):** Identified

The strategic answers to the conclusion questions and recommendations for improving the next year's sales strategy are provided in the **`conclusions.txt`** file.

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes the following visualizations to present the data effectively:

* Line chart for each product across months.
* Stacked bar chart of total monthly sales by product (annotating the best month).
* Seaborn heatmap illustrating monthly sales of each product.
* Seaborn boxplot displaying the distribution of sales per product.
